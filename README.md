# Code-for-the-paper-of-An-Effective-and-Efficient-Approach
A project in the service of the paper "Error checking large database through data mining: An effective and efficient approach"
The project consists of two parts, FPG.java and test.java, where FPG.java is mainly used to find low-frequency associations in the database and is the core part of the whole project. test.java is used as the main code to implement the function of random sampling and finding wrong data with low-frequency associations.
(In addition, the file called "Data for Demonstration.xlsx" is a small part of the data extracted from the experimental database of the paper for the user test code.)
